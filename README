Detailed description:
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
    FishCode is a simple program that encrypts files (text and binary) using a custom algorithm (described below).
The program works with files as byte arrays, so the file type has no effect on the result, and therefore can encrypt
videos, images and text files using the same algorithm.
    The program works with 128-bit data blocks and a 128-bit key. File encryption and decryption is carried out in 15
rounds. The file is encrypted in blocks up to 128 bits (16 bytes). A unique key is generated for each round, this key
is derived from the main key.
    Each round of encryption has the following sequence of actions:
    1. bytes swap (if the file contains 2 or more bytes of data);
    2. round key generation;
    3. combining the key with each block of data (byte-by-byte) using a bitwise XOR operation.
    Each round of decryption is performed in the following sequence:
    1. round key generation;
    2. combining the key with each block of data (byte-by-byte) using a bitwise XOR operation;
    3. bytes swap (if the file contains 2 or more bytes of data).
    For encryption, the key is generated using a pseudo-random number generation algorithm. When encrypting a file,
the user enters a password that can contain upper and lowercase Latin letters, special characters, numbers from 0 to 9.
The password cannot contain spaces and non-Latin letters and symbols that are not part of the ASCII character set.
The password is used to encrypt and decrypt the key, because the key is written in the encrypted file (at the beginning
of the file). When decrypting the master file, the key is decrypted using a password, which makes it impossible to
accidentally guess the master key and decrypt the file without entering the password.

    FishCode interface consists of two main components: the main window and an additional menu called "More...".
    The main window has three input fields ("Input file", "Output file", "Password") and five buttons ("Choose...",
"Set...", "Encrypt", "Decrypt", "Cancel").
    "Input file" and "Output file" fields are for entering path to the corresponding files on the disk.
The file path can be either absolute, such as "/home/user/Documents/file", or relative, such as "Documents/file".
    "Choose..." and "Set..." buttons are alternative ways to identify the relevant files. These buttons bring up
the corresponding dialog boxes.
    "Encrypt" and "Decrypt" buttons perform the operations corresponding to their name. Status of the operation is
displayed in the progress bar and at the bottom of the window, in the status field.
    The "Cancel" button can abort encryption or decryption task.
    Note: password cannot contain spaces, non-Latin letters and symbols that are not part of the ASCII character set.
